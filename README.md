# Tailwind Moon

A soothing dark theme based on Tailwind CSS default color scheme. This theme was based on Praveen Puglia's excellent "Tailwind Breeze" theme and is meant as a dark counterpart for those who like having matching light and dark themes for their text editor.

## Changelog
### 2.4
- Added _Tailwind Moon Gray_ theme using Tailwind's `colors.gray` palette instead of `colors.coolGrey`
- Added _Tailwind Moon Blue theme using Tailwind's `colors.blueGray` palette instead of `colors.coolGrey`
- Fixed selected list item background colour being identical to the widget background, making focused items in the Command Palette hard to distinguish

### 2.3.2
- Required due to README.md edit

### 2.3.0
- Changed terminal background colour to fit text editor.
- Changed Git colours to be less intrusive.
- Fixed light mode file icons being used instead of dark mode file icons; this was apparently because the theme was still declared as a light theme. It's now declared as a dark theme.
- Darkened sidebar slightly.
- Tweaked highlight colours in sidebar.
- Fixed title bar text colour being too dark and hard to read.
- Fixed widget shadow (on e.g. find, command palette) being white instead of dark.
